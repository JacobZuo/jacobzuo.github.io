## Research interest

* **Emergent Phenomena in Complex Ecosystems**: Investigating how interactions within microbial communities give rise to emergent properties, such as stability, resilience, and adaptability, under varying environmental conditions.

* **Spatial Assembly of Microbial Communities**: Exploring the spatial organization and temporal dynamics of microbial communities, focusing on how spatial structuring influences microbial interactions, community function, and ecological processes.

* **Intraspecies and Interspecies Interactions**: Unraveling the mechanisms of competition and cooperation within and between species, highlighting their roles in shaping community composition, ecosystem function, and evolutionary trajectories.

* **Communication and Signaling in Microbial Systems**: Deciphering intracellular and intercellular communication networks, including quorum sensing, signaling pathways, and metabolite exchanges, to understand coordination and decision-making in microbial communities.

* **Adaptation and Evolution Under Environmental Stress**: Investigating how microorganisms adapt and evolve in response to environmental stressors, with an emphasis on the genetic, metabolic, and ecological mechanisms driving these changes.
